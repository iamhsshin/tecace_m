                    <strong>Personal information you disclose to us</strong> <br />
                    We offer wide range of Services through our App. To provide you the best Services that fit your needs, we collect varying information depending on the Services and activities you use on the App. However, we only collect the minimum personal information needed for you to use our

                    preferences, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our App and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
                </p>
                <p>The following information is needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, for troubleshooting and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information we automatically collect when you access or use our App and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP

                    <li>
                        Location Data.

How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you
                        use to access the App. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You may personalize the settings on your device to stop sharing your locations. Your location will not be
                        collected when you stop sharing your location. However, you may not be able to use certain Services on the App.

                    <li>Wearable Device Access. We may request access or permission to certain features from your wearable device, including your mobile device’s microphone, and other features. You may personalize the setting on your device to change our access permission.</li>
